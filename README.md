# About
Protect-PHP is a simple, password protection tool with one static password and username to protect a page. This uses bootstrap CSS, and is very simple, hence only one file needed (other files are on a CDN)<br>
<br>
# Install
Protect-PHP is very easy to install, here's how ya do it.<br>
<br>
1: Download or copy the contents of index.php<br>
2: Edit the file, replacing line 6 with your username and line 7 with your password.<br>
3: Edit line 12 and rename content.php to the file you want to protect. But, don't just name it content.php. It is recommended you name the file a random string of at least 10 letters and numbers for security.<br>
